## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   npm install -D tailwindcss

4. **Initialize Tailwind CSS:**
   
   ```bash

  This will create a tailwind.config.js file with default configurations.
  
5. **Set Up Your CSS File:**
  Create a src/styles.css file and add the following content to import Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities:

   ```bash
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;

6. **Build your CSS**:
   Build the Tailwind CSS file and output it to public/styles.css:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/styles.css

## Usage

- **Development**: Use the commands above to build your Tailwind CSS file. Include the output CSS file (public/styles.css) in your HTML file(s).
- **HTML**: Reference the built CSS file in your HTML:

  ```bash
  <link href="public/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">

- **Adding Tailwind Classes**: Utilize Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in your HTML to style your elements.

## Development

- To rebuild your CSS whenever changes are made, you can run the Tailwind CSS build command:

  ```bash
  npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/styles.css

For a more streamlined development process, you might consider using a build tool like PostCSS to automatically process Tailwind CSS.
